# Machine learning algorithms
This repo contains various popular machine learning algorithms.<br>
Many of these are written from scratch so that one can understand the backbone of each algorithm [[1]](#1)[[2]](#2).<br>
The list is not comprehensive, and I will keep updating.

To run the notebooks, you need the following python packages:
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- json
- pandas
